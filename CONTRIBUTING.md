# How to contribute

Thank you for reading this.  I'd love to have more interest and volunteer developers to help build Luxelot.

I am actively looking for like-minded (pro-privacy, pro-C# right now) people who want to chat more.

If you haven't already, come find us in Matrix ([Luxelot](https://matrix.to/#/#luxelot:matrix.org) on matrix.org).

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to luxelot](https://github.com/seanmcelroy/luxelot/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

Thanks,
Sean McElroy
