# Ping

This app provides simple PING and PONG messages across Luxelot.

The simpliest app that demonstrates how to send and respond to messages, ping includes a console command that supports pinging neighbors directly by their PeerShortName, or by specifying both a PeerShortName and another node's thumbprint, it will 'source route' the ping to the designated peer such that the peer will broadcast it out to the rest of the network.
